# Data Analysis for Gun Violence
Data science is not the code, (although, of course you will need those), but it is more of an art than a science: imagine,visualize,  and  actualize

Analysis of Gun Deaths in the US
Based on data from http://fivethirtyeight.com/ For the years 2012,2013 and 2014 
- How do the rates of the reported deaths vary  with race, age,cause, month, year, gender, etc
- How is the involvement of the police in those deaths per race?
- Now that the reported numbers are rising(http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) what should be done, and where do we start. 

Some Findings
- The rate of deaths is highest in the Blacks and least in Asians >
- Over half of the deaths in Hispanics and Blacks involves Homicide
- The rate per 100000 of the gun deaths involving the police is lowest among whites 

Usage:
intent_rel_gender > gives the relationship between the cause of violence and gender
intent_rel_month > How about we find out which month is the worst in these cases?
ranking_the_intents > which is the worst
count_by_police > police vs. race involvement
count_by_homicide > race vs. intent
count_race_per_hundrendk > Deaths in race:population (per 100000)
count_race > deaths per race
count_gender >  deaths per gender
count_monthly_deaths > overall months in the 3 years
count_yearly_deaths >  deaths per year
